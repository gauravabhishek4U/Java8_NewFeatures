A method reference in Java is a concise shorthand syntax for a lambda expression that refers to an existing method or constructor.
Method references, introduced in Java 8, improve code readability and reduce boilerplate by allowing you to pass a method's name as an argument where a functional interface is expected.

There are three types of Method References:
    - Static Method Reference
    - Instance Method Reference
    - Constructor Method Reference

A new operator :: (double colon) called as Method Reference Delimiter to specify Method References


Static Method Reference :
    - Allows to access existing static methods

    Syntax - Class::staticMethod
    Example -   Hello hello = MyInteger::findSum;
                (Here, Hello is a functional interface)


Instance Method Reference :
    - Allows to access existing instance or non-static methods

    Syntax - objRef::instanceMethod
    Example -   MyInteger myIntRef = new MyInteger();
                Hello hello = MyIntRef::findSum;
                 (Here, Hello is a functional interface)


Constructor Reference :
    - Allows to access constructor of a class to create the object

    Syntax - Class::new
    Example - Hello hello = Class::new;
